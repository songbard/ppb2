__UPDATE 30 April 2022:  Based on work contained in this repository, Dr. Brown presented testimony to the US District Court for Oregon about changes since 2017 in the rate, burden, and severity of use of force against persons likely to be mentally impaired in Portland, Oregon.

This GitHub repository is a space for open collaboration on the development and analysis of data describing activities of the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), and other police departments.

The now publicly released PPB data were created thanks to a Settlement Agreement between the uS Dept of Justice and the Portland Police Bureau to improve use of force against persons in mental health crises.  (In addition to providing raw data, PPB publishes quarterly reports on use of force by its officers and provides an interactive dashboard that allows simple cross-tabulation of these and other data on the Bureau's website, www.https://www.portland.gov/police/open-data) 

The initial focuse of the work is to measure and explain changes in use of force against persons with mental dysfunction and addiction, against racial and other minorities, and others.    

We have so far used the powerful free and open-source data-handling and statistical software, R.  However, any statastical software can be used in the GitHub environment.  Most people use R within the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R called RStudio. Each R script (program) indicates which R packages must be loaded and used to run that script, and each contains the code and links to source datasets necessary to run that script.  So far, R scripts have been written with the RMarkdown package, which allows one to produce a pdf or other document to document ones thinking and work and/or to draft a formal publication that is easy to revise.

The work was started by Jonathan Betz Brown, MPP, PhD, working with the Portland Mental Health Alliance, of which he is a member.  There is no financial or institutional sponsorship. Participants are volunteers.  Dr. Brown pays for the GitHub hosting and is the initial administrator of the site.

What is asked of participants?:  honesty, an unbiased scientific approach, commitment to open access and transparency, responsible behavior, and shared authorship if academic papers are submitted based on collaborative work.  Users of our code and data do not need to post your work to this repository but we hope you want to work with us.
